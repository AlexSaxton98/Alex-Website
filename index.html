                <p>Hi, I'm Alex, a nerd from Manchester who loves all things Sci-Fi, Fantasy and so much more!</p>
                <p>I have a background in Art and Design, specifically 3D fabrication, costume design and 3D modelling. In the past I have primarily used these skills for creating costumes and cosplay</p>
                <p>I am incredibly interested in learning to code, as I see it as another creative avenue that I can pursue, particularly using HTML and CSS to design webpages, though I also have experience using languages like Python to create small text adventures and logic puzzles, which you can play on this site!</p>
                <p>I was interested in joining Code Nation because of their impressive claims of training people up from scratch to becoming employable coders and developers</p>
