            <p>As a part of the course with CodeNation, we were tasked with making a game in Python. My team decided to make a game where we each made our own puzzles and then combine them together at the end. This is the puzzle that I put together for this game.</p>

            <p><small>Disclaimer: This version of the game has a tendency to fail when calling a function, seemingly at random times. All efforts to test this code outside of Trinket have worked fine, however importing it to trinket has caused these issues to surface. I have yet to find any explanation as to why, as there is no failing in my code.</small></p>
